# Python-feature-rich-desktop-application

Creating a more feature-rich Python desktop application can involve adding multiple buttons and functionalities. For simplicity, we will extend the previous example to include additional features like opening a file, showing the current time, and exiting the application.

Here's how you can do it:

Install Python (if you haven't already): Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

Create the Python script:

## Save and Run the Script:
Save the script as multi_feature_app.py.
Run the script by opening a terminal (or command prompt) and executing: python multi_feature_app.py.
Explanation of Features
Say Hello: Displays a pop-up with a "Hello, World!" message.
Open File: Opens a file dialog allowing the user to select a file, and then shows the selected file path in a pop-up.
Show Time: Displays the current date and time in a pop-up.
Exit: Closes the application.
